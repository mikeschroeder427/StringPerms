Java 1.8

The ActOnUtils.jar can be run from the cmd line like so...
	java -jar ActOnUtils.jar <string>

Or can be imported into a project by using the following statement, import ActOnUtils.*, and calling the static method PrintUniqueStringPermutations. In this form, it currently only accepts strings. In this form, the function will print the strings to console, and it will also return a string array with the unique values.

I wouldnt recommend putting inputs larger than 11 chars as the function runs O(n!). *If you have Musks' new super computer, let it rip*
